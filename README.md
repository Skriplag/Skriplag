## Orbita

Orbita is free open source application for creating personal blog with subscriptions.

You can think this as a simple self-hosted analog of **Patreon**, **Boosty** and **OnlyFans**.

The point is to store your content on your server without any limitations from big platform holders.
With Orbita you are able to publish your content and receive money from a grateful audience.

This application is designed to be installed on your own server using Docker.
You will not need to follow the rules of a third-party platform and pay its fees.
Payments from subscribers will be sent directly to your payment gateway.

**You own your server and all the data.**

### How to run

```
git clone https://github.com/bezumkin/orbita.git
cd orbita
cp .env.dist .env
docker compose up --build
```

I assume you will use some web proxy with TLS certificate to handle connections, so by default Orbita listen only 
`http://127.0.0.1:8080`. You can change the host by adding `NGINX_HOST=0.0.0.0` in the `.env`.

Admin panel is available under `your-site-url.com/admin`, login with user `admin` and password `admin`.

### Payment gateways

There are some built-in gateways located in `core/src/Services/Payments`. 
Please use it as an example for your payment connectors. They should extend abstract class `PaymentService`.

Active gateways are listed under `PAYMENT_SERVICES` setting. 
Services supporting subscriptions (periodical payments) should also be listed under `PAYMENT_SUBSCRIPTIONS`.

Don't forget to put `svg` logo of new service into `frontend/src/public/payments`. 

Payment classes are `CamelCase`, logo images are `kebab-case`.

### Issues

This is a new project, many things could be unclear, so don't hesitate to ask your questions. 
I will continue to develop this project according to your feedback!
